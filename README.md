My snake game, and my flanker task experiment.

Snake:

You steer the snake using W, A, S and D.
You can set a difficulty yourself, but beware, it does get very difficult.
If the mouse doesn't appear (happened sometimes), just wait, it should spawn in a different location shortly. 

Experiment:

in the GUI, you can actually determine, whether you want to record location or not. Turning this feature off is quite useful, if you want to take a look at the result file.
It's a lot easier to read without the location.
